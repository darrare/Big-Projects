Create a folder somewhere to hold all repositories.

Automatically pulling the first set of repositories not automated yet, so you will need to git bash - "git clone sadlkjnasldjkansd" on all of the folders initially in order to build your folder structure..

After the folders are built once, put the .exe generated from this project along side each individual repository and run it. It has 2 features right now, swapping first/last name and pulling every repository located next to the .exe.

NOTE: When run, this program will reset every repo in the same directory as the .exe to the master branch. If you have any uncommited changes, they will be lost.
